# vmam: VLAN Mac-address Authentication Manager

`vmam` is a command line tool which allows the management and maintenance of the mac-addresses 
that access the network under a specific domain and a specific VLAN, through LDAP authentication.
This is based on [RFC 3580](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3580).
