Config Mode
***********

To generate an empty configuration file, type at the command line (or through its function, see the *vmam* module):

.. code-block:: console

    vmam config --new <path-to-configuration>.yml

If you don't specify the file path, it will create a configuration file in a default path: ``/etc/vmam/vmam.yml``


The configuration file is in `YAML <https://yaml.org/>`_ format.

Get prerequisites configuration
===============================

Once you have compiled the configuration file with your values, to get the prerequisites scheme, just run this command:

.. code-block:: console

    vmam config --get-cmd <path-to-configuration>.yml

If you don't specify the file path, it will create a configuration file in a default path: ``/etc/vmam/vmam.yml``
