Creation
========

The process of creating a mac-address user involves these steps:

2. Insertion in the VLAN group according to the parameters of the configuration file
3. Insertion in the custom group based on the parameters of the configuration file
4. Check if other VLAN groups are assigned to the user
5. Set password equals as a mac-address
